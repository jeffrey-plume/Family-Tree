# 🌳 Plume Family Tree

Welcome to the **Plume Family Tree** project!  
This project brings our family history to life with interactive visualizations generated directly from a GEDCOM file.

---

## 📜 Project Overview
- Built with **Python**, **Plotly**, and **NetworkX**.
- Parses family relationships from a `.ged` (GEDCOM) file.
- Displays both an interactive family tree **and** a birthplaces map.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- **Family Tree**:  
  - Individuals are nodes; parent-child relationships are edges.
  - Node colors indicate the country of birth.
  - Hovering over nodes shows full birth and death information.

- **Birthplaces Map**:  
  - Pins each individual’s birthplace on an interactive world map.
  - Hovering over pins shows names and birth dates.
